/**
 * The one home for "which glyph means which status" on mobile (#1256).
 *
 * The task editor and the inbox-processing steps each picked their own: the hourglass meant
 * Waiting in the editor and Incubate in the steps, and Someday was a calendar in one and a cloud
 * in the other. Every lucide surface reads this map now.
 *
 * It follows MOBILE's navigation (app/(drawer)/(tabs)/_layout.tsx, a different icon library):
 * Waiting is a pause circle, Someday an up-arrow circle, Reference a closed book. Someday is not
 * a clock here, unlike desktop: on Android the menu already uses the clock for History.
 * Waiting is never the hourglass, which this editor uses for Time estimate.
