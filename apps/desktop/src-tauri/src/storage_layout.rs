//! Standard (installed) profile layout.
//!
//! Windows and macOS resolve the app's OS config dir and data dir to the same
//! folder (`%APPDATA%\mindwtr`, `~/Library/Application Support/mindwtr`), so an
//! installed build used to pile config files and data files side by side there
//! while the portable build kept `profile/config/` and `profile/data/` apart
//! (#1245). This module gives those installs the same two subfolders, and
//! migrates an older flat folder once, before the first config or database
//! read. On Linux the two OS dirs are already distinct and nothing changes.
//!
//! The migration is a journaled, same-volume `fs::rename` of a fixed list of
//! entries the app itself writes. It never touches anything else in the folder
//! and never deletes a file. A downgrade is not supported: an older build looks
//! only at the flat root.
//!
//! Three things keep a half-finished run from ever being read as a whole
//! profile:
//!
//! * A lock file makes one process at a time mutate the folder. The migration
//!   runs inside the path lookup, which happens before the single-instance
//!   plugin exists, so it cannot lean on that plugin. A second process waits a
//!   few seconds for the holder and then re-reads the folder, because either
//!   process may be the one the single-instance plugin keeps — and if the
//!   holder gave up, the waiter gives up too rather than move the folder under
//!   a process that has settled on the flat root.
//! * The journal is published atomically and synced before the first rename,
//!   and removed only after every rename is durable, so a power loss is always
//!   visible to the next start.
//! * A failure rolls the whole folder back to the flat layout — including
//!   moves an earlier crashed run made — and that run keeps reading the flat
//!   root. The journal is left in place for the next start to finish.
