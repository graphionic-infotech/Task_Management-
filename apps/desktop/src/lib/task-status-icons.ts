/**
 * The one home for "which glyph means which status" on desktop (#1256).
 *
 * The sidebar, the editor's Status pills and the inbox-processing wizard each picked their own
 * icons: Someday was a clock in one place and a calendar in another, the hourglass meant Waiting
 * in the editor and Incubate in the wizard, and two wizard buttons in one row shared a clock. An
 * icon only helps if it means one thing, so every surface reads this map.
 *
 * The sidebar's choices win where they existed (they are the oldest and the most seen). Waiting is
 * NOT the hourglass: the same editor already uses the hourglass for Time estimate.
