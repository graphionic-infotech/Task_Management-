# Performance and stability

Start with the [session handoff](stability-handoff.md): completed work, findings,
rejected experiments, remaining coverage, and the prioritized improvement plan.

- [Baselines and profiling](baselines.md): reproducible commands, measurement
  boundaries, device/build identity, isolation, and artifact requirements.
- [Performance budgets](budgets.md): existing fast CI regression gates.

## Investigation reports

Reports retain the evidence and limitations of each experiment. Read later
follow-ups before acting on an older report's next-step recommendation.

Raw traces, builds, maps, and synthetic databases stay outside Git. The
[diagnostics ledger](../release-notes/diagnostics-ledger.md) remains the source of
truth for release markers and what a tester's log can prove.
