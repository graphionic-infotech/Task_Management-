# Cloud attachment shape recovery — September 13, 2026

Issue [#1205](https://github.com/dongdongbh/Mindwtr/issues/1205) reports a Linux
sync failure after an automation created a task through the Cloud API. The
reported payload puts a URL string in `props.attachments`; the diagnostic stack
matches the shared outbound attachment sanitizer calling `.map` on that string.
The reported empty due date is independent of the attachment-shape failure.

## Scope and accepted behavior

- New task/project API writes and whole-document uploads validate attachment
  arrays before persistence. Invalid input returns 400 without changing saved
  data. Null clearing, empty arrays, valid file/link records and tombstones remain
  supported. Task status belongs inside `props` on create.
- Shared sync document parsing recognizes previously saved absolute HTTP(S) URL
  strings and preserves them as link attachments. IDs derive from owner type,
  owner ID and URI; timestamps derive from existing owner timestamps or a fixed
  sentinel. No random IDs, current-clock timestamps, URL downloads, or task text
  changes are introduced. Purged owners do not regain attachment payloads.
- Other malformed attachment structures fail with a field-path error, without
  deleting or replacing the document. Existing valid arrays retain identity.
- A repaired remote read requests one write through the existing sync conflict,
  freshness and mutation-fence path. Comparing two normalized documents must not
  skip that repair. A subsequent unchanged cycle skips the write normally.
- Cloud record reads normalize old stored links before use. The raw-file trust
  cache remains separate from the parsed-data cache: repaired memory cannot mark
  unrepaired disk bytes trusted. A sync download publishes an accepted repair
  through the existing atomic writer under the namespace lock, then serves the
  saved bytes. A failed publication leaves the old bytes untrusted and intact.

The core and Cloud diagnostic markers are documented in the
[diagnostics ledger](../release-notes/diagnostics-ledger.md). Client normalization
and server persistence are separate proofs. Neither marker alone proves a
successful end-to-end sync on the reporter's devices.

## Validation and remaining confirmation

The initial recovery integration tests reproduced failures with input validation
alone: old-data GET returned 500 and direct PATCH returned 400. After recovery,
seven real local HTTP-server tests pass, covering saved/downloaded byte equality,
HEAD content length, no rewrite on the second GET, direct PATCH before any sync
download, PUT merging before any sync download, failed-write retry, stale
trusted-file identity, purged-only cleanup,
and unchanged unsupported malformed documents. The full Cloud suite passes
299 tests; Cloud typecheck and lint pass. Core document/sync-run/diagnostics tests
pass 147 cases, including null compatibility, deterministic convergence, retained
metadata, privacy-safe logging and the one-write/unchanged-second-cycle behavior.
The full core suite passes 3,964 tests with 8 skipped; core typecheck and scoped
lint pass. The seven core performance-budget tests also pass.

Independent review closed the required-field validation gap for attachment
records. The full core run exposed one fixture that supplied `name` instead of
the required `title`; correcting that fixture preserved its canonical-read
contract. Cloud review also required storage-root checks around the post-repair
file read and a second-GET assertion on inode and modification/change times,
so identical response bytes cannot hide repeated rewrites.

Public Cloud API docs include a valid automation payload in all six languages;
their production build and full docs checks pass. Docs revision `8972fd1` is
published, and [docs CI 34792525815](https://github.com/dongdongbh/mindwtr-web/actions/runs/34792525815)
passed. This work uses disposable
synthetic data on a loopback HTTP server. No reporter server, personal database,
Android app, or iOS device was accessed. Reporter confirmation after upgrade
remains open; check the exact published revision's CI separately.

Local logs and red/candidate/final results are retained under
`/home/dd/.cache/mindwtr-checklist-focus/issue-1205-*`. The engineering packets live
in the isolated worktree's ignored `.orchestrator/tasks/issue-1205-*` directories.

## Related Inbox clarification

Issue [#1204](https://github.com/dongdongbh/Mindwtr/issues/1204) changes the mobile
and desktop guided processing label to the existing translated **Contexts**,
which also covers tools and people. Existing desktop/mobile component suites
pass 19 and 90 tests respectively; this visible copy change needs no diagnostic
marker or separate public documentation.

The initial [web CI run](https://github.com/dongdongbh/Mindwtr/actions/runs/34792870326)
exposed one remaining old-label expectation in `e2e/clarify.spec.ts`. The follow-up
expects **Contexts** and scopes guided-step choices to the main content, keeping
the sidebar's identically named button separate. The complete guided flow passes
in local Chromium, including the persisted Next status and project assignment.
The independent [Native Platform CI run](https://github.com/dongdongbh/Mindwtr/actions/runs/34792870327)
for application revision `1a52efe1e` passed. Check the test follow-up's exact CI
revision for final web and desktop integration status.

The screenshot in [#1206](https://github.com/dongdongbh/Mindwtr/issues/1206) is in
Quick mode. Its list icon switches to Guided mode. Both modes intentionally
share the final filing screen, so a switch there affects the saved mode without
changing that screen's controls. No behavior change was made for that question.
